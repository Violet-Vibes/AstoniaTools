[Stat Exporter 0.1](https://github.com/Violet-Vibes/AstoniaTools/releases/download/0.1/bmod.dll)

To use this mod, you need the SDL client. Copy `bmod.dll` to the `bin\` folder in your installation. 

If you already have other mods, you might need to rename it to something like `cmod.dll`.

Use `/export` to export your character stats to your desktop.(It'll be named CharacterName.json)

Primary usage is for [Resurgence Stat Calculator](https://www.astoniaresurgence.com/downloads/ResurgenceStatCalc.exe)
